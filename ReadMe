This Project is a Camera that Detects & Tracks Faces Using the Neural Compute Stick 2, Openvino & Opencv on a Rasbperry pi 
with a pi camera mounted on a Pan Tilt Servo Mount that Follows and Centers on Detected Faces.

components 
  -Raspberry pi 
  -Neural Compute Stick 2
  -pi Camera
  -Pan / Tilt Servo mount 
  -External power for the servos 5v 2 amps with common ground as the raspberry pi

servo setup
  -Center both pan / tilt servo to 90 degrees "center" using a arduino or servo tester
  -Mount pi camera to pan tilt mount

servo wiring 
  -Wire Pan Servo signal wire to GPIO 13, Gnd to Raspberry pi Gnd & Power to external 5v 
  -Wire Tilt Servo signal wire to GPIO 19, Gnd to Raspberry pi Gnd & Power to external 5v 

plugin pi camera to raspberry pi 
Plug in Neural compute stick 2 into raspberry pi
Install Openvino for the Neural Compute Stick 2 for Raspbian OS
